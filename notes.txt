CLASSES:
sketch.js - main, will continue to handle mapbox requests for now.
data.js - gets all data needed + makes global JS object to store it (using mercador function).

Data class will have a funciton to load data and add it to a weather obj, this obj will be stored in main
The dataload func will be called in sketch.js preload.



I am going to have to learn more about OOP in JS to get to know it more!

P5 particles research:

-create a grid of cells
-each cell gets an angle (need to use average angles for cells with no angle or two angles)
-each cell gets a strength (will also need to use averages)
-can use get() to find if the cell is in land (checks the color of an image pixel)


Will help to have a cell class:
vars:
active (is cell inland)
wind dir (deg);
wind strength (this needs to be put into a map function);
