CLASSES:
sketch.js - main, will continue to handle mapbox requests for now.
data.js - gets all data needed + makes global JS object to store it (using mercador function).

Data class will have a funciton to load data and add it to a weather obj, this obj will be stored in main
The dataload func will be called in sketch.js preload.



I am going to have to learn more about OOP in JS to get to know it more!

P5 particles research:

-create a grid of cells
-each cell gets an angle (need to use average angles for cells with no angle or two angles)
-each cell gets a strength (will also need to use averages)
-can use get() to find if the cell is in land (checks the color of an image pixel)


Will help to have a cell class:
vars:
active (is cell inland)
wind dir (deg);
wind strength (this needs to be put into a map function);


Loop through each cell:
- check all cities and get values for nearby
- use lerp to give each citys value a nearness weighting
- calculate average angle and wind speed using nearness weightings

Instead of checking each cell we could check the nearest first


let windSpeed = 0, windDirection = 0, temprature = 0, distanceMultiplier = 0;		/* temp variables store totals (to be used for averages later) */
			for(let c = 0; data.list[c].length; c++){	/* loop throgh all cities in dataset */
				distance = dist(x, y, data.list.mapX, data.list.mapY);	/* calculate distance between the current point and the city */
				
			}


Am I going to get this done: (3AM)
-get average values for all variables	/
-problems with angles	/
-blend colours over cells
-adjust particles to represent wind
-html


Stuff from perlin noise vid:
-used 2d perlin
-started with pixels - how to change to vectors
-creates scale value
-cols = floor(width / sale);


we can map the cells wind speed to an acceleration value (between -0.5 and 0.5?)
this can be used for the particle acceleration value
-REMEMBER - the acceleration is stored as a vector (we could instead add a vector in direction of wind)

- he uses applyForce() func to add to acceleration
